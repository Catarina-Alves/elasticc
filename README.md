# ELAsTiCC
Repo for settings, config, metrics for DESC's Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge

## Taxonomy
Code to generate an illustration of the extendable taxonomy lives [here](https://github.com/plasticc/taxonomy).

## Metrics
Code for the metrics can be imported from [ProClaM](https://github.com/aimalz/proclam) (Probabilistic Classification Metrics), which is Python 3 code developed for PLAsTiCC to model classifier archetypes and evaluate metrics.
